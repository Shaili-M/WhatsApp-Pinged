# WhatsApp Pinged

This Flutter App encounters one of the major issue you all might also be facing in WhatsApp, which is that we have to save the contact of the person if we want to send the message to him/her.<br>
But there are many encounters where we might never need the contact of that person in future and still we needed to save their contact, keeping this problem in mind I created this app which allows you to send the WhatsApp message to any number without having you save it in our device.<br>

You can choose any country code and create a WhatsApp message without saving the contact in your device.<br>
